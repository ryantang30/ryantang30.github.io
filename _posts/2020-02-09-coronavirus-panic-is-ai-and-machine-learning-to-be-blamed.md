So by now everyone must have heard about the 2019 Novel Coronavirus outbreak that has now been spread all over the world with over 700 deaths worldwide at this time of writing.
People all over the world are reacting with quite frankly, more emotion that logic. Although this virus is more contagious than SARS, it is much less fatal. According to PM Lee's statement about the virus, outside of the Hubei Province in China (The epicenter of the outbreak), the fatality rate of the coronavirus is only 0.2%, compared to 10% fatality rate of SARS.
So what's different between the 2002/2003 SARS and this 2019/2020 Coronavirus? What changed that made people panic so much more now that in 2003? I remember SARS as a kid in primary school. We had to take temperatures a few times a day and I always hoped to run a small slight fever so that I can go home and play games. I don't remember the panic, the fear and the drastic actions people are taking now.
In Singapore, at the time of writing, there are 40 confirmed cases, with zero deaths. When the government announced the raised the DORSCON (Disease Outbreak Response System Condition) to Orange on 7th Feb, the panic set in the local population and people cleared out supermarkets.


So what's to blame? Why are people reacting differently today as compared to 17 years ago during SARS?
Well, I am not the only ones to ask this question. The Singapore Psychological Society explained this behavior as being triggered due to "times of stress and uncertainty".

In times of stress and uncertainty, this thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system, resulting in 𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗰 and 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿. This translates into a phenomenon more commonly known as survival mode or fight-or-flight, which is driven by the need for self-preservation, protection, and safety.
What I want to know is why do so many people feel that these are "times of stress and uncertainty" ? The reason, I believe is because of AI and Machine Learning. Let me explain.
What is AI / Machine Learning?

These buzzwords have been floating around in the tech world for the past few years and while people know the word, I'm not sure how many have a basic understanding of how it works. So this is my attempt at explaining this in the simplest way possible:
Say if you want to create a program to learn how to differentiate images of fruits. Here's how you would do it using machine learning:
Step 1: Get a bunch of images of apples, pears and other fruits and label them. Step 2: Train a neural network by showing it images of each fruit and its label.Step 3: Use the trained model to predict the labels of new images it has not seen.
And that's basically the gist of it. Over time as the network sees more images of fruits and gets feedback on whether it's prediction is correct of not, it will become better and more efficient in differentiating the types of fruits.
How would AI / Machine Learning lead to panic over the virus?

It's 2020, we live in an age whereby the news we consume comes from social media and news app on our mobile phones. Our interactions with the rest of the world and knowledge about things that happen around us comes from social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and Tiktok. News comes from news apps like Google News.
All of these companies heavily rely on AI and Machine Learning to provide you with the content you like to see. They do this in various ways but basically the gist of it is the following:
Step 1: Collect data on your interactions on social media. Such as whether you "like" an Instagram post,  how long you spending reading a Facebook post, whether you have been texting your friend about a topic on WhatsApp (Yes your text messages via WhatsApp are read by Facebook - if an app is free, you are the product)Step 2: Feed this data into their super well trained neural network and train the network to know what you likeStep 3: Show you the content that the neural network has predicted you would like based on your data
All social media and search engine giants do this. This is how they make money off your data as advertisers will pay top dollar to get their product in front of people who would actually buy them.
As such, when a big important event such as the outbreak of the coronavirus happens, it goes viral very quickly. But it does not stop there. As any post or news you read about the coronavirus is logged by these tech companies, and while you might not "like" a coronavirus post, you would certainly spend time reading it carefully as it might contain useful information. What happens then is that the machine learning algorithms will think that you are highly interested in this content and keep showing you more. And you would keep reading more as these are important information and you should know about it. But for someone did not try to distance themselves from the news and calm down, it is very easy to start panicking.
I have been following the coronavirus outbreak on my Google News app and I find that my entire feed is about the coronavirus, news after news of people dying, new cases around the world, how people are panicking everywhere. To be honest, reading all of that, it is not easy to stay logical and calm. While this virus is not trivial and should not be dismissed, we should not be panicking so much as well and machine learning the media is not helping.
Here's an experiment for you to try: Go create a new TikTok account, in the For You page, only like posts that mentions the severity and panic caused by the coronavirus and watch them in full. Ignore all other posts and quickly scroll by them. After about 15 mins of doing this, you will realize your entire feed is full of news and panic about the coronavirus and you might feel that these are "times of stress and uncertainty" as well.
