_NOTE: This project has been completed but I have not written an article about it. I started this blog in Apr 2021 as I decided that I should document all my projects somewhere online for my own reference and also so that it might help someone else. Problem now is that I have done so many projects so far that it is going to take me some time to complete writing articles and document all of them. If this project's title and description sounds like something you will be interested in, **please comment below so that I know which articles to prioritize.** Thanks and welcome to my website! :)_
